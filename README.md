# javascript-challenge
This project uses Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a web application that dynamically generates a searchable table of UFO sightings.

## Web Application
This web application initially displays all available reports of UFO sightings. The user can further filter results based on the date, city or state of the sighting. 

It consists of:
- a Javascript file (app.js) 
- an HTML file (index.html)
- a file of UFO sightings (data.js)
- various Bootstrap CSS, image and Jquery files

## Getting Started

To run this aplication simply launch the index.html file with your browser.
